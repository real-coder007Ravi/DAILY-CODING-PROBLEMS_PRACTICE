DRY RUN BEFORE THE INTERVIEWER
X=5 ,T=3
LET THE NUMER TO FIND IS Y(MAXIMUJM ACHIEVABLE NUMBER] SUCH THAT X+T=Y-T
the further applying maths we get Y=X+2T hence the answer will be X+2T.
//BRUTE FORCE
HERE WE ARE GETTING A NUMBER SUPPOSE 5 AND THEN ADDING 3 WE GET 8 AND ON RIGHT HAND SIDE WE NEED ANOTHER NUMBER SUCH THAT SUBTRACTING THE Y WITH 3 WILL GET THE SAME VALUE AS 8
5+3=Y-3  =>Y=5+3+3=11
